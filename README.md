# Workday-Schedule-App

Users have the opportunity to schedule out their day by storing hourly tasks in a scheduling app.
Current day is displayed on the top of the page using moment.js

To use:

Type your tasks/comments in the text area for the hour of your choice, and click the blue icon on the right to save your input.
Based on the current time, hours that have already passed will be greyed out. The present hour will be red, and hours that have not yet come to pass will be green.
